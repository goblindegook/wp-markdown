# Markdown for WordPress

A plugin that adds Markdown support and code syntax highlighting to WordPress.

I developed this for personal use, and I offer it as-is, with no intention to please any crowds.  There are many Markdown plugins in the repository and I encourage you to try those first, I only created this because none of them gave me exactly what I needed.

This plugin uses [Parsedown Extra](http://parsedown.org) to render Markdown, with [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com) for syntax highlighting.

## Installation

This plugin is not available in the repository, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install it:

```bash
$ composer require goblindegook/wp-markdown-g
```

If you want to know more about using Composer with WordPress, there's [a good introduction at the Roots project site](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/).
