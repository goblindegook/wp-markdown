# Change Log

## [1.3.1]

* Fixes the `language-` class prefix in code blocks for compatibility with Prism.js.

## [1.3.0]

* Replaced Parsedown with Markdown Extra, which comes with a performance penalty but doesn't mangle HTML (such as the markup generated by oEmbed).

## [1.2.0]

* Caches converted HTML.

## [1.1.2]

* Fixes handling of quote entities when combined with `wptexturize()`.

## [1.1.1]

* WordPress 4.4 compatibility fixes.

## [1.1.0]

* Exports Markdown document metadata.
* New `markdown_metadata` filter.
* Fixed rewrite rules for the `.text` pseudo-extension on pages and subpages.

## [1.0.4]

* Convert Markdown in text widgets.

## [1.0.3]

* Fixed rewrite rules for the `.text` pseudo-extension.

## [1.0.2]

* Supports adding `.text` to a post slug to get its raw Markdown content. Only works with public, non-password protected posts. (Adding `?export=markdown` to a single post request also works.)

## [1.0.1]

* Fixes shortcode processing.

## 1.0.0

* Initial release.
* Markdown rendering using Parsedown.
* Syntax highlighting using Prism.js.
